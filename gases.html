            <p>Gases are the least stable form of matter that we interact with on a daily basis, there are less stable phases, but we don't see them too often. The molecules in a gas can move completely freely, and will fill the container they are in, no matter the shape. They are still partially constrained by gravity, but they spread out much further than liquids. Gases would be things like the air we breath, or the fumes coming out of a car. Be careful though, because some things act like a gas but aren't, smoke is one. Smoke is actually lots of little flakes of a burnt material, that is light enough the air can lift it.</p>
